# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project showcases an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a sample Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

---

## 📁 Dataset

We’re using a small sample dataset modeled after the original Titanic dataset. The data includes:

- **Survived**: 0 = No, 1 = Yes
- **Pclass**: 1 = First, 2 = Second, 3 = Third
- **Sex**: Male/Female
- **Age**: Passenger age in years
- **Fare**: Ticket fare

---

## 🔍 Objectives

- Analyze survival counts
- Explore passenger class distribution
- Visualize gender counts
- Examine age distributions
- Analyze relationships between variables (correlations, boxplots, etc.)
- Summarize key findings

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for data visualization

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- More passengers did not survive (6 out of 10).
- Majority of passengers were in 3rd class.
- More male passengers than female.
- Age distribution ranges from 2 to 54 years.
- Younger passengers tended to be in lower classes.
- Survival positively correlated with fare and passenger class.

---

## 💡 Summary

- Women had higher survival rates.
- Higher class passengers had better survival chances.
- Fare is positively correlated with survival.

A PDF/Word report with visuals and observations is also available for download (if uploaded to the repository).
